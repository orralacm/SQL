Introduction to SQL

SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.

What is SQL?
SQL stands for Structured Query Language
SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987

What Can SQL do?
-Execute queries against a database
-Retrieve data from a database
-Insert records in a database
-Update records in a database
-Delete records from a database
-Create new databases
-Create new tables in a database
-Create stored procedures in a database
-Create views in a database
-Set permissions on tables, procedures, and views


SQL is a Standard - BUT...

Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.
However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.

Note: Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard!


Using SQL in Your Web Site

To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:

-An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)
-To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
-To use SQL to get the data you want
-To use HTML / CSS to style the page


RDBMS

RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.
The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.

Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields.
A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table.
A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.
