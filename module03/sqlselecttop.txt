SQL TOP, LIMIT, FETCH FIRST or ROWNUM Clause

The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.
The SELECT TOP clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact performance.

Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY and ROWNUM.


SQL TOP, LIMIT and FETCH FIRST example: selects the first three records from the "Customers" table

For SQL Server/MS Access:

SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;

For MySQL:

SELECT * FROM Customers
LIMIT 3;

For Oracle:

SELECT * FROM Customers
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;


SQL TOP PERCENT example: select the first 50% of the records from ther "Customers" table

For SQL Server/MS Access:

SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;

For Oracle:

SELECT * FROM Customers
FETCH FIRST 50 PERCENT ROWS ONLY;


ADD a WHERE CLAUSE

Example: select the first three records from the "Customers" table, where the country is "Germany"

For SQL Server/MS Access:

SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany';

For MySQL:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
LIMIT 3;

For Oracle:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
